About
-----
This demo is a basic, Linux-based, example of how to use GPIO Sysfs Interface
for userspace. The 'gpio' application is used to manipulate GPIO pins – sets
outputs and reads inputs.

It is split into two separate functionalities: generic wrapper over GPIO sysfs
interface and (gpio_func.c) and a command line interface (gpio_sample.c).


Requirements
------------
Before running the demo make sure that Linux Kernel is compiled with enabled
support for GPIO sysfs interface and GPIO driver for S32V234.
Both options can be enabled from menuconfig menu (make menuconfig) or with
'bitbake -c menuconfig virtual/kernel' from Yocto build:
    * Device Drivers -> GPIO Support -> /sys/class/gpio/...
    * Device Drivers -> GPIO Support -> Memory mapped GPIO drivers ->
      GPIO driver for S32V234

The schematic of the board might be needed in order to associate GPIO ids
with pins.


Compilation and running
-------------------------
To compile the demo, simply run "make" from this folder or from the parent
folder containing all the demos.

The demo exposes two operations: set and read the value of a GPIO pin.
Before proceeding to next steps make sure that you identified 2 GPIO pins.
One of the pins will be configured as input pin and another as output pin.
The pins must be physically connected using a wire or a jumper.

Let's consider that IPIN is the input pin and OPIN is the output pin.

Launch the demo instances:
   root@s32v234evb:~# (for s in $(seq 1 1 50); do for v in $(seq 0 1 1); do ./gpio OPIN $v; sleep 1;done; done) &
   root@s32v234evb:~# ./gpio IPIN

The former command exports OPIN, sets its direction to "out" and writes
0 or 1 for 50 times. The latter command reads and prints each second
the value of IPIN. The values of IPIN should alternate between 0 and 1
since the pins are connected.
