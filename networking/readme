The networking sample  will simulate a TCP server-client chat. The connection
will be established through sockets and the communication is basically a
stop-and-wait sequence: both server and client wait for a response after sending
a message.

Execution flow:

	*	From the server compilation will result an executable file that
	receives as parameter the port.
	*	In order to find the server(if it is available), the client should
	know the name or its IP address. There are two arguments that
	should be specified at the execution, the IP address and the number
	of the port that the socket will use.
	*	Practically, after the "make"/"make server"/"make client" command,
	we must turn on the server and give it a number for the	port. For example,
	if we want to use the port with the number 1923, the right command will
	be "./server 1923"
	*	Once the server is turned on, the client can connect to it. Assuming
	that the IP address of the server is 192.168.0.1, the client will connect
	with the command "./client 192.168.0.1 1923". After that, the client can
	start the conversation.

Example:
	* Start server using port 1923:
		./server 1923
	* Start client on the same host:
		./client 127.0.0.1 1923
