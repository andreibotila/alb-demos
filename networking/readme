The networking sample will simulate a TCP server-client and a TCP
server-multiclient communication.The connection will be established through sockets.

The server-client example is basically a stop-and-wait sequence: both server and client
wait for a response after sending a message.

The server-multiclient example shows how more the one client can connect to the same
server. Clients send messages read from stdin and server replies with an ack for the
received message. Handling input from more than one client is implemented using poll.

Build:
 * make server - builds the single-client server
 * make server_multiclient - builds the multi-clientserver
 * make client - builds the client
 * make - builds all above

Execution flow:
 * Server (single-client/multi-client) receives as argument the port number.
 * Client needs two arguments:
	- the IP address of the machine where the server is running.
	- the port number used by the server for listening for new connections.

 The client reads data from stdin until end-of-line is received and sends it to
 the choosen server. Next, it waits for a reply from server which will be printed
 to stdout. This message exchange is interrupted when "quit" is read frm stdin.

 The single-client server (server executable) can communicate with only one client.
 It also reads data from stdin and sends it to the client, after a message from the
 former is received.

 The multi-client server (server_multiclient executable) can communicate with more
 than one client. It waits for messages from any of the connected clients and sends
 back an acknowledgement.

Example:
	* Start server using port 1923:
		./server 1923
		      or
		./server_multiclient 1923
	* Start client on the same host:
		./client 127.0.0.1 1923
